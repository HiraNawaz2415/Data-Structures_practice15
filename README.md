# Data Structures in C++

## What is a Data Structure?
A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
## Why Do We Need Data Structures?
Because real-world problems involve:

- Storing huge amounts of data (like search engines or databases)

- Fast access, insertion, deletion, sorting, etc.

- Memory management and performance optimization

## Common Types Of Data Structures

| Category       | Examples                         | Description                                                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linear**     | Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue | Store data in a sequential manner                             |
| **Non-Linear** | Tree, Graph                      | Data is arranged hierarchically or with complex relationships |
| **Hash-based** | Hash Table / Hash Map            | Key-value pair structure for fast access                      |
| **Set-based**  | Set                              | Collection of unique elements                                 |

## Examples
**Array:** Fixed size, index-based access
 - Useful for: quick lookups by index.

**Linked List:** Dynamic size, node-based
 - Useful when insertions/deletions happen frequently.

**Stack:** LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)
 - Used in undo operations, parsing, etc.

**Queue:** FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
 - Used in scheduling, printers, etc.

**Tree:** Hierarchical data
 - Used in file systems, databases (e.g., AVL, BST).

**Graph:** Nodes connected by edges
 - Used in social networks, maps, etc.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays (searching, sorting operations)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
- Stacks Oerations
- Queues Operations
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS)
- Sorting Algorithms

## How to Use
Each folder contains C++ implementations of a specific data structure or algorithm. You can compile and run them using g++ or any C++ compiler.
