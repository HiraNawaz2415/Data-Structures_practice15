# **What is a Queue?**
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. The element that is inserted first is the one to be removed first.

## Real-life Examples of Queues:
- People standing in line at a ticket counter.
- Print jobs sent to a printer.
- Task scheduling in operating systems.
